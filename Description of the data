The course organizers made the dataset available in csv format. The dataset was uploaded on a Jupyter notebook for initial analysis.The main item of the dataset would be the injured people. 

We can check what are the other information in the dataset:
  - speed;
  - date and time;
  - if the street was wet;
  - visibility conditions;
  - etc.

We can verify if there is any combination that increases the incidence of accidents resulting in injured people.
